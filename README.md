My mission is to deliver outstanding products through collaboration, continuous learning, and a strong focus on clean, efficient code. I'm currently focusing on **full stack development**, gaining skills on front-end frameworks like *React*, *Astro*; also **back-end experience** by developing **API's and database managment**. For last, i'm also (for the future), looking forward to data engineering!
